### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Kartik this side. I am a software engineer by profession and passion. I started writing recently but somehow got lucky and got over 300K views on Medium.com. I have also written documentation for Apache Airflow, such as the Best Practices guide.

I currently live in Bengaluru, India, so most of my day involves me being stuck in traffic with my job as a secondary activity.

I read books (like 1-2 per month, which is not a lot) but only non-fiction or science fiction. Memes keep me alive. Most of the time, you can find me browsing either Twitter or Reddit.

My taste in music is eclectic. As an example, my current Spotify playlist consists of Punjabi, Rap, K-pop, EDMs, metal, piano covers of movie/anime soundtracks, and one Egyptian song. For any opportunities, ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kharekartik/) or drop an email to kharekartik@gmail.com.
